# Golden test for #412 — auto-dev dispatched every worker into the supervisor's OWN cwd.
#
# #314 moved workers from one-shot `claude -p` processes (which got their own cwd) to in-process
# background sub-agents (which inherit the supervisor's). Step 3's dispatch form was carried over
# unchanged, so the property the fleet's whole conflict strategy rests on — "one area per
# concurrent worker" — silently stopped being true whenever the supervisor itself ran in a
# worktree: every worker landed in that same tree instead of one of its own, and the first one to
# `git switch -c` moved every other worker's HEAD out from under it.
#
# This suite pins the textual invariants that fix it, one per plan task:
#   1. Step 3's dispatch form (both the phase-1 and phase-2 spawn blocks) carries the Agent tool's
#      `isolation: "worktree"` option, and *Gotchas* names the cwd-inheritance hazard.
#   2. commands/auto-dev-worker.md and commands/auto-dev-merge.md each state that the given
#      worktree IS the worktree — no nesting another one, no touching a path outside it.
#   3. SKILL.md documents a first-act toplevel assertion (the worker reports `git rev-parse
#      --show-toplevel`; the supervisor refuses a match against its own) and what happens on a
#      refusal — re-dispatch correctly, don't let the worker proceed, don't count it BLOCKED. The
#      decision itself is a marked, extractable shell program (same discipline as
#      tests/pr-existence-guard/test.sh, modeled on it) so this suite proves the exact thing an
#      agent would paste, not a paraphrase of it.
#
# Reads only files under commands/ and skills/auto-dev/ — never samples/ — so no kit_guard is needed.
