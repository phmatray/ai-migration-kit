# Golden test for skills/auto-dev/scripts/usage_report.py's transcript discovery (#281) and, since
# 2.0, for measure_phase2.py's by-issue pairing of the two sub-agent transcripts a worker leaves (#314).
#
# The bug: the script discovered sessions with one glob, `<proj>/*.jsonl`, which matches only the
# transcripts sitting DIRECTLY in the project directory. A worker dispatched via the Agent tool
# writes its transcript to `<proj>/<session-id>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl` instead — a layout the
# glob never opens, and nothing in the output said so. Measured on this repo's own 2026-08-27
# fleet run: 21 sub-agent transcripts carrying 86% of the run's tokens were silently invisible,
# and the ORCHESTRATOR vs WORKERS split was wrong in exactly the direction that flatters the
# orchestrator's share.
