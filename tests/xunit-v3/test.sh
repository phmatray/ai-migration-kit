# xunit v2 -> v3 golden test.
#
# Guards the phase-5 "test platform" item end to end:
#   1. the inventory reports the test stack precisely enough to decide the v2/v3 question;
#   2. the documented transform really produces a running v3 test project;
#   3. the OutputType trap — a v3 project left as a library — is pinned as 0 tests, not 6;
#   4. coverage still reaches the dashboard under the Microsoft Testing Platform — one report per
#      test project, and the template's own step is executed rather than a copy of it;
#   5. the decision is wired into phases 1, 5 and 6, not merely documented in a side file;
#   6. project shapes the fixture does not have (element-form refs, flat indent, multi-TFM,
#      packages.config, central package management) are all handled;
#   7. the xunit.v3 / CodeCoverage version pairing is machine-checked, not remembered — and no
#      ambient environment value can steer the transform, so every override is an explicit flag;
#      `--help` names the package AND the version the transform actually writes (the docstring
#      sends readers there for the pinned value), and every prose claim about that version — in the
#      module's own comments and in the migration reference agents read — is swept for agreement,
#      so a Renovate bump cannot leave a measurement standing that nobody re-took;
#   8. tests/ and scripts/ load kit scripts through exactly one module loader — the shared
#      tests/_lib/py.sh — so the no-__pycache__ invariant that loader carries cannot be lost to a
#      copy-paste, in this file or in any other (#51 widened this from "THIS FILE");
#   9. Renovate can actually SEE those two pins and actually HOLDS their majors — the custom
#      managers are executed against the real file, and the holds are tested for REACH, so a config
#      the engine would reject, or protection that has been scoped away from the pins, fails here
#      instead of surfacing as PRs that silently never appear;
#  10. the find probes report what they FOUND — not how the reader exited, and not whether the
#      starting path happened to exist. A SIGPIPE'd find under `pipefail` used to make two of this
#      file's own checks skip themselves precisely when they had something to report (#48), and the
#      first-match form used to abort the suite AT the assignment, before the diagnostic written
#      directly beneath it could say what had gone wrong (#98).
#
# The committed fixture is never mutated: cleanup() asserts it on every exit path, and CI asserts it
# stays "green AND legacy".
#
# There is exactly ONE completion marker — the final `xunit v3 golden test OK`. Section lines carry a
# label, never a fraction: a denominator goes stale the moment a section is added, and a stale one
# reads as a run that stopped early.
#
# Everything that builds runs on a COPY under $(mktemp -d). samples/LegacyShop is read-only here.

# 4f. A test project that CANNOT collect coverage must fail the run, not shrink the report set.
#
#     Issue #31 assumed a project missing Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CodeCoverage would
#     contribute nothing while its siblings still reported — leaving the job green on a union
#     that is quietly partial, the same wrong-answer shape as #17 one level up.
#
#     Measured instead (2026-08-10, SDK 10.0.302, xunit.v3 3.2.2, CodeCoverage 17.14.2):  # pinned:xunit-v3
#     `--coverage` is an option CONTRIBUTED BY that extension, so without it MTP does not skip
#     collection — it refuses the option, `Unknown option '--coverage'`, and the test app exits
#     non-zero. Under the step's `set -euo pipefail` that fails the step outright, before the
#     guard below ever runs. The report set is never silently partial for this cause.
#
#     So the guarantee #31 asked for already holds — but by ACCIDENT of MTP's argument parsing,
#     with nothing pinning it. An MTP release that downgraded an unknown option to a warning
#     would reopen the hole in silence, and the guard could not see it: one healthy sibling's
#     report satisfies a presence check. This case is that pin.
#
#     It asserts the REASON, not merely a non-zero exit. A restore failure or a build break also
#     exits non-zero and would satisfy a bare `if ! …; then` while proving nothing — the trap 4a
#     documents for itself.

# 8. The no-__pycache__ invariant lives in exactly one place ACROSS tests/ AND scripts/.
#
#    Loading a kit script through importlib compiles it, and without
#    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE that drops a __pycache__ next to it — which the no_pycache guard
#    turns into a suite-wide failure, for a reason unrelated to whatever was being tested. The
#    prefix is therefore load-bearing and invisible at the call site, which is exactly the shape
#    that gets lost in a copy-paste. One loader, asserted here, so a new call site cannot
#    reintroduce it.
#
#    #42 could only claim this for THIS FILE, and said so rather than overstating it: the grep
#    read $SELF alone, while tests/report-dashboard/test.sh carried a second loader for its own
#    module. That copy was correct — it did carry the prefix — but nothing asserted it, so an edit
#    dropping the prefix would have stranded a __pycache__ under scripts/ and surfaced it in THIS
#    suite's exit guard, naming a file this suite never touches. Misdirection of exactly the kind
#    section 8 exists to prevent, one directory over (#51).
#
#    So the scope is now tests/ and scripts/, and the single definition must live in the shared
#    helper. Both halves matter: a count alone would be satisfied by any one file keeping a
#    private loader, which is the arrangement this replaced.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#    The `[l]` is not a typo: it keeps this grep from counting its own pattern — including in this
#    very file, which the recursive scan now reads — so the assertion measures the kit's loaders
#    rather than itself.
#    `|| true` because `grep` exits 1 when there is no match, and under `set -e` an assignment from
#    a failing substitution kills the script — so the one case this block exists to describe (the
#    loader removed or renamed) would abort with no output at all, right where the message is the
#    entire point. The paths are relative to the kit root this script cd'd to before anything else,
#    which is also what makes the reported paths match $LOADER_HOME verbatim.
#
#    Scanned through $KIT — ABSOLUTE — and not through the relative `tests scripts`. The property
#    the old $SELF spelling had, and that a relative operand silently gives up: this suite cd's
#    into scratch copies five times below and only happens to cd back each time. The first section
#    that leaves the cwd elsewhere would make this grep read a scratch tree, or error to stderr —
#    and with `|| true` that reads as ZERO loaders, i.e. a FAIL blaming a removal that never
#    happened. The `$KIT/` prefix is stripped back off before comparing, so $LOADER_HOME stays a
#    repo-relative path a reader can open.
#
#    The pattern is one literal spelling — `spec_from_file_[l]ocation`, bracketed here for the very
#    reason this section exists — and the claim is scoped to match: it is the only loader idiom the
#    kit uses. `__import__`, `importlib.import_module` after
#    a sys.path insert, and runpy would each write bytecode without tripping this grep. Saying so
#    here rather than pretending otherwise is the same honesty #42 applied to its own narrower
#    scope — and broadening the pattern is a follow-up, not a silent widening of a claim.

    does not, so a pattern using one would match happily here while Renovate's own compile throws
    CONFIG_VALIDATION and stops managing the repo entirely — whose only symptom is that no PRs ever
    appear again. A guard that is green on a config the real engine refuses is worse than no guard.

    Everything RE2 omits, it omits for one reason — it guarantees linear-time matching, and every
    construct below needs backtracking. That is a principle, not a list, and the probes here are a
    best effort at covering it rather than a proof: Python keeps ADDING such constructs (atomic
    groups and possessive quantifiers arrived in 3.11 and were missed by the first version of this
    check), so treat it as extendable, not closed.

    The probes are independent of each other — `(?<!` does NOT match the lookahead probe, because

    reading, not correctness. (An earlier revision of this comment claimed the opposite and was
    simply wrong; it is checked now rather than asserted, by `_lookbehind` below.)

    the bottom can drive it with deliberately broken copies. That is the whole point: every hole
    #67 records was a assertion that had never once been executed against a config it should
    refuse, so it was impossible to tell a working guard from a decorative one.

    `unevaluated` is the other half of that contract, and it is one list rather than four: every

    refuses on a non-empty list no matter how well the rest of the config reads. #99 measured what
    the alternative costs — six spellings Renovate honours that this guard accepted, because each
    site decided locally that what it could not read was harmless.

    THE BOUNDARY THIS SECTION DOES NOT CROSS: `cfg` is the UNRESOLVED renovate.json, read straight
    off disk. Renovate resolves `extends` first and merges the preset underneath the local keys, so
    everything a preset contributes is invisible here — `cfg.get("ignorePaths")` is empty today
    because the file declares none, not because nothing ignores the transform, and a preset setting
    `enabledManagers` would disable the custom managers repo-wide while every assertion below still
    passed. This repo extends `local>phmatray/.github:renovate-ci` (#99, hole 4).

    Resolving a preset means fetching another repository, which is exactly what this section must
    not do — it is the offline, always-runnable half of the pair. The engine-backed half is
    `tests/renovate-config/`, where the real renovate-config-validator judges this file instead of a
    model of it. Note the honest limit even there: the validator is handed the file, so it does not

# 10. A "did we find any?" probe reports on what it FOUND, not on how the reader exited.
#
#     `find … | grep -q .` under `set -o pipefail` inverts on large results: grep exits at the
#     first match, find takes SIGPIPE on the closed pipe and returns 141, and pipefail makes that
#     the pipeline's status — so the `if` takes its else-branch, the one that means "nothing
#     there", exactly when something IS there. Two call sites had this shape (#48): section 4a's
#     canary, which exists to be LOUD the day the VSTest collector starts working under MTP, and
#     cleanup()'s __pycache__ guard, which exists to catch a stray .pyc reaching the tree. Both
#     failed silent, and a small result set hides it — one match fits in the pipe buffer and find
#     finishes before grep can close it.
#
#     So the fixture is deliberately big enough to overrun the 64 KiB pipe buffer, and the naive
#     shape is run first: if IT stopped failing, this case would be proving nothing, and that is
#     reported as a broken fixture rather than quietly passing.
