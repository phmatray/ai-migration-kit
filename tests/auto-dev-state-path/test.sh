# Golden test for auto-dev's pinned state-file path (#417 Task 2).
#
# Before this issue, skills/auto-dev/SKILL.md Step 2 told the supervisor to persist its state file
# "outside the repo (a scratch/temp dir, not a tracked path)" — prose an agent interprets, not a path
# a hook can read. #417's Stop hook (hooks/autodev-stop-gate.sh) needs to find that file without
# being told where it is, so the path has to be PINNED and DERIVABLE from the repository alone.
#
# This suite is a grep over SKILL.md's Step 2 and Step 6 text, not an execution of the skill (there
# is nothing to execute — the skill is a markdown procedure a model follows). It pins two things:
#   1. Step 2 states the path as the derivable expression the hook computes independently, and keeps
#      the existing "outside the repo, never tracked" requirement intact;
#   2. Step 6 removes the file on drain, which is what makes an absent file mean "no fleet running
#      here" rather than "a fleet ran once, years ago, and never cleaned up."
