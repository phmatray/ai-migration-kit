# Golden test for the systematic-debugging feedback loop (#320).
#
# The skill's Phase 1 now gates hypothesising behind a command the agent has ALREADY RUN, and the
# material that says how to build one lives in three shipped artifacts plus two pointers. Each of
# them is invisible when it goes missing: a reference nothing links is a file nobody opens, a
# template nobody runs is a template that stopped working three refactors ago, an eval that is not
# in the set cannot fail, and a pointer that was dropped from merge-pr looks exactly like a pointer
# that was never needed. So this suite pins all four, by the same rule the rest of tests/ follows —
# a tool the kit ships is a tool the kit tests.
#
# Four assertions, in the order the plan for #320 names them:
#   (a) feedback-loop.md exists, credits its source, and SKILL.md links it from BOTH Phase 1 (where
#       an agent in trouble reads) and Bundled techniques (where an agent browsing reads).
#   (b) scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh actually runs with piped stdin and emits its KEY=VALUE dump —
#       the part the agent parses, and the only part a syntax-only check cannot prove.
#   (c) the eval set parses AND carries `loop-before-hypothesis`, the one eval whose expected
#       output is a command that was run rather than a theory that was formed.
#   (d) merge-pr's `fix-check` correction and implement-issue's green-wall blocker — the two places
#       the kit meets broken code unattended — each name the skill at that exact spot, not merely
#       somewhere in the file.
