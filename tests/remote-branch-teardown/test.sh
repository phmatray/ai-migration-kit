# Golden test for merge-pr's remote-branch-teardown.sh (#185).
#
# Step 7 used to assume the remote head branch was already gone by the time it ran — via Step 5's
# `--delete-branch` or the repo's own `delete_branch_on_merge` — and never checked. On a repo
# without that setting on, and on the kit's own layout (the branch lives in an `implement-issue`
# worktree, so gh's local delete fails first and short-circuits before it ever reaches the remote
# side — confirmed by reading `mergeRun` in `cli/cli`, Task 1 of #185), that assumption is false:
# `origin/<headRefName>` leaks permanently and nothing ever notices.
#
# remote-branch-teardown.sh is not fixture-file driven — it shells out to `git ls-remote` and
# `gh api -X DELETE`, so this suite stubs both (same idiom as tests/guarded-git/test.sh) rather than
# feeding it JSON. Three shapes from the issue's own Task 3, plus the race the script itself
# documents tolerating (a concurrent delete winning between the ls-remote and the DELETE call) and
# the two refusal paths (bad usage, a genuine ls-remote failure).
