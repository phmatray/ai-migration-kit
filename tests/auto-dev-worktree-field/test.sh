# Golden test for the auto-dev normal MERGED report's WORKTREE handling (#234).
#
# `skills/auto-dev/SKILL.md` Step 4's normal `Reported MERGED` bullet acted purely on a worker's
# `STATUS: MERGED` field and never read the same report's `WORKTREE` field, even though
# `commands/auto-dev-merge.md` mandates that field carry exactly this information. `merge-pr`'s own
# Step 7 is documented as tolerant of partial local cleanup (e.g. `git worktree remove` needing
# `--force` on a dirty leftover, or a `git branch -D` racing something else), so a worker can
# legitimately report `STATUS: MERGED` with `WORKTREE: branch deleted, worktree still present` — and
# that worker was shut down and its slot refilled without anything noticing the leftover.
#
# The fix has the bullet read `WORKTREE` before refilling: a fully-cleaned result proceeds
# unchanged, anything else (including a missing field, which is non-clean, not evidence of success)
# is recorded in a new `## Needs manual sweep` state-file section before the slot is still refilled
# regardless — the PR is merged, only local cleanup is outstanding. This suite pins the textual
# invariants so none regresses silently; it asserts SKILL.md prose, not runtime behavior — this repo
# has no harness that runs `auto-dev` end-to-end, so its golden suites for this skill assert
# structural properties of the doc itself (see tests/auto-dev-never-wait/test.sh for the established
# pattern).
