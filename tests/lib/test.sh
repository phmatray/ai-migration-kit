#
# The helper exists so ten suites stop each carrying their own EXIT trap (#72). The invariant it
# centralises is one line — `local rc=$?` must be the FIRST statement in the handler — and getting
# it wrong turns a FAILING suite into a silent green. Every suite that sources this file now
# depends on that being right here, so it is driven for real rather than restated in a comment.
#
# What is asserted:
#   1. a failing suite still exits non-zero — the invariant, and the reason this file exists;
#   2. a passing suite exits zero, and its scratch directories are gone;
#   3. a registered guard that fails turns a PASSING suite red, and prints its own message;
#   4. a registered guard that passes leaves the status alone;
#   5. `kit_guard_samples_unchanged` catches a mutated samples/ and is silent otherwise;
#   6. `first_match`/`any_match` answer correctly, do NOT trip SIGPIPE with many matches (#48),
#      and tolerate a starting path that does not exist instead of aborting the caller (#98);
#   7. sourcing is loud when the helper is missing — a suite must never run unguarded;
#   8. no suite hand-rolls the EXIT trap again — the anti-recurrence check;
#   9. a suite that uses the helper takes its scratch from it, per occurrence;
#  10. a suite that does NOT use it still leaves no scratch obtained from `mktemp` behind — so §9
#      and §10 together cover every suite's `mktemp` usage, and nothing falls between them (#128);
#      narrowed to that instrument in #160, which is also what §13 exists to cover the remainder of;
#  11. `kit_source` loads a helper and refuses, by name, one it cannot;
#  12. no suite sources a shared helper unguarded — the anti-recurrence check for §11;
#  13. no suite writes a literal `/tmp/…` path — a text-keyed lint, not a coverage claim (#160).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 9. A suite that USES the helper must take its scratch from it.
#
#    Membership is DECLARED BY BEHAVIOUR: a suite is audited when it CALLS kit_init, the thing that
#    actually arms the handler. It used to be inferred from whether the text of the file happened to
#    contain the string `_lib.sh` (#128). That was cheap while there was one shared file with one
#    obvious name; #51 added tests/_lib/py.sh, whose name differs by one character in a position
#    nobody reads, and the audit's reach then depended on spelling. Both halves were wrong, and both
#    were measured:
#
#      * appending the comment `# voir tests/_lib.sh` to a suite that manages its own scratch turned
#        THIS file red — four offenders — for a reason unrelated to the edit;
#      * tests/report-dashboard/test.sh deliberately avoided the substring, and sat in the audit's
#        blind spot while leaking a directory on every run. §9 exists to catch exactly that, and by
#        construction never could. That leak is fixed in the same change.
#
#    A suite may legitimately want py_module without the preamble, so sourcing tests/_lib/py.sh is
#    NOT membership — another distinction a filename match cannot draw.
#
#    Not every suite is a member. Those that manage their own scratch with an inline `rm -rf` are
#    out of scope here; the real difference, for whoever converts one, is that an inline `rm -rf` at
#    the end runs only on the success path, so a suite that fails midway leaves its directory
#    behind, whereas kit_scratch's is removed on every exit path. Worth doing; the audit does not
#    fail over it.
#
#    Within a member suite, though, a stray `mktemp -d` IS a leak — kit_cleanup only removes what
#    lives under its own parent directory.
#
#    Checked PER OCCURRENCE, not per file. Exempting a whole file the moment it mentions
#    `kit_scratch` anywhere is the opposite of the leak described above, and it had a live
#    instance: tests/audit-inventory ran `( cd "$(mktemp -d)" && … )` for its foreign-cwd case, a
#    directory outside KIT_LIB_TMP that nothing removes, in a suite this change converted.
#
#    Both halves are FUNCTIONS so the fixtures below can drive them directly. The real tree cannot
#    tell a right rule from a wrong one here: every live suite answers the same way under either,
#    which is precisely how a wrong rule survived (#128).

# Is $1 a member of the shared library — i.e. does it CALL kit_init?
#
# A call, never a mention. BOTH kinds of comment are dropped first — the whole-line kind and the
# trailing kind — and the name must then sit at a command position, so prose about the helper (this
# file is full of it, and so are the suites) cannot decide who gets audited. That is the defect
# class #128 is about, so reproducing it here would be a poor joke, and dropping only whole-line
# comments would have reproduced exactly half of it: a mention pushed to the end of a code line
# still sits after whitespace, which is a command position to any pattern that looks for one.
#
# The trailing strip keys on whitespace before the `#`, which is what keeps it from eating the
# shell's other uses of that character: `${x#*|}`, `$((n + 1))`-style arithmetic and quoted paths
# have no space in front of theirs. The residue it accepts is a `kit_init` written AFTER a quoted
# `#` on one line — a false NEGATIVE, so a suite would have to hide itself from an audit it opted
# into, and no suite in the tree writes anything of the sort.
#
# Pipe-free on purpose. `grep -v … | grep -q …` lets the reader exit on the first hit; under the
# `set -o pipefail` at the top of this file the writer's SIGPIPE (141) becomes the pipeline's
# status, and "found it" reads back as "not a member" (#48). An audit is the last place that should
# go unnoticed: the failure mode is a silently empty roster, which looks exactly like a clean run.

# line each. A `mktemp -d` rooted under a kit_scratch result is fine — that IS inside KIT_LIB_TMP.
#
# Comments are dropped the SAME two ways suite_is_member drops them, and for the same reason: a
# call and a mention of a call must not look alike. The glob this replaces — `[[:space:]]*\#*` —
# read as "one whitespace character, anything, a `#`, anything", because `*` after a bracket
# expression is a wildcard and not a repetition. Measured: `    d=$(mktemp -d) # note` was skipped
# AS A COMMENT while the same line unindented was flagged, so an indented stray directory escaped
# the audit the moment anyone appended a trailing note to its line. That is a false NEGATIVE in the
# section whose entire job is to find leaks — the failure it produces is a clean-looking run.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 10. A suite that is NOT a member must not leak scratch obtained from `mktemp` either.
#
#     NARROWED (#160): this section's instrument is the `mktemp` shim below, so its claim is about
#     scratch obtained THAT WAY, not about every temp artefact a suite might produce. That gap had a
#     live instance — tests/followups/test.sh wrote two FIXED `/tmp` paths, calling `mktemp` never,
#     so this section's ledger stayed empty and it reported clean while the suite leaked on every
#     run. §9 does not cover it either (it audits `mktemp -d` calls inside members). A fixed path is
#     invisible to both, by construction, until it is spelled literally — which is what §13's lint is
#     for; that is a text-keyed anti-recurrence measure, not a wider version of this section's claim.
#
#     §9 covers the members: kit_cleanup removes what kit_scratch took, on every exit path. A suite
#     that manages its own scratch is outside that guarantee, and nothing ever measured it — which
#     is how tests/report-dashboard/test.sh came to leak a directory on every single run, unnoticed
#     (#128). It was in §9's blind spot by construction, since §9 keyed on a filename that suite
#     deliberately avoided spelling. The two sections together now cover every suite's `mktemp`
#     scratch, so a change that moves a suite from one side to the other cannot drop it out of both.
#
#     BEHAVIOURAL, not textual: the suite is run for real, every path `mktemp` hands it is recorded,
#     and the ones that still exist afterwards are the leak. A suite that cleans up correctly comes
#     out clean whichever spelling it used, and there is no pattern to keep in step with the code —
#     which is the whole point, after a rule keyed on spelling missed a real leak.
#
#     The live loop visits every NON-MEMBER, with no further gate — the `grep -q mktemp` that used
#     to stand in front of it is gone, because deciding who gets measured by whether four letters
#     appear in the file is the inference #128 exists to delete, and it had already reduced this
#     loop to zero suites (see the roster note below).
#
#     The FIXTURES are what keep this honest when that roster is empty, which it legitimately can
#     be: convert every suite and §9 owns them all. Driving a deliberately leaky suite through the
#     same harness proves the detector still detects — and it earned its place twice during #128,
#     catching both of the wrong mechanisms tried before this one. The count of suites actually
#     inspected is printed, so a section that measured nothing says so instead of implying it did.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What NOT to do, both measured rather than reasoned about:
#
#   * "run it with TMPDIR pointing somewhere private, then look in there." `mktemp -d` with no
#     template — the form every self-managing suite uses — honours $TMPDIR under GNU coreutils and
#     IGNORES it under BSD/macOS, which takes the per-user temp dir regardless. On a maintainer's
#     Mac the check would have measured an empty directory and printed OK.
#   * "…and re-root it with -p so both mktemps comply." That works, but everything ELSE that reads
#     TMPDIR writes there too: probing for `node` and `dotnet` in tests/preflight deposited
#     `node-compile-cache` and `NuGetScratch`, and the suite was accused of leaking them.
#
# So the ledger: a one-file `mktemp` shim, first on PATH, appends every path the real mktemp returns
# and otherwise behaves identically. Attribution is then exact — these are the paths THIS suite was
# handed — and it needs no environment override at all, so the suite runs in its normal conditions.

#     BARE and keeps going asserts less than it claims to while still printing OK, which is the

#
#     It had a live instance when this was written: tests/xunit-v3/test.sh guarded one of its two

#     written both halves of (#128) — the same "copy-paste is not a thing people decide to do"

#
#     Enumerated from the filesystem, never from a list here (#45), and over the shared helpers as
#     well as the suites — a rule its own subjects are exempt from is not a rule. tests/lib/test.sh
#     is the one exemption: it sources the file under test deliberately, guarded by its own `[ -r ]`
#     check at the top, and the illustrative preamble in §11's comment above would otherwise match.

#
#   * the SPELLING of the builtin. Both `.` and `source`; `source` is what a newcomer reaches for.
#   * the PATH. The old pattern required the literal text `tests/_lib` on the line, so
#     `lib="$KIT/tests/_lib.sh"; . "$lib"` — the variable form, and the very shape §9's `calls_it`
#     fixture uses to show a member hiding from a substring rule — sailed through unguarded. There
#     is no reason to source anything in a suite without a guard, so the rule is now simply "every
#     source is guarded" and there is no path to be blind to.
#   * WHICH FILES get scanned. tests/_lib.sh and tests/_lib/*.sh are shared helpers that may source
#     shared helpers; scanning only tests/*/test.sh left them out of their own rule.
#
# What it must not catch is `source = open(…)` inside a Python heredoc — an assignment, not a

# 13. No suite writes a literal `/tmp/…` path — the lint §10 was narrowed FOR (#160).
#
#     Text-keyed, not behavioural: it greps for the four characters `/tmp/`, so a suite that hides
#     the same string in a variable (`t=/tmp; f="$t/x"`) sails through unseen. §10 does NOT close
#     that gap either: its instrument is the `mktemp` shim, so a suite that builds a hidden path this
#     way and creates it with anything other than `mktemp` (`mkdir -p "$f"`, `install -d`, …) leaves
#     no trace in either section's ledger — both report clean while the directory leaks forever. That
#     residual gap is real and unclosed; catching it would need value tracking through variables,
#     which is a taint-analysis problem this text-keyed lint does not attempt. What THIS section does
#     catch is the hazard at the moment a fixed path is WRITTEN LITERALLY, whether or not the run that
#     follows happens to leak or collide on it. A lint, not a coverage claim, and it must not be read
#     as a wider one than §10 was just narrowed to.
#
#     A line may carry the `tmp-lint:allow` marker — a bare token, the same shape as
#     pinned-literals-check.py's `pinned:<pin>` — to record a DELIBERATE literal. The marker sits on
#     the line it excuses, in a trailing comment, so the exemption cannot drift out of step with what
#     it is exempting: tests/renovate-config/test.sh sets a config's `baseDir` to `/tmp/renovate` to
#     prove the validator rejects it — the string is test DATA, not a path this suite writes to.
