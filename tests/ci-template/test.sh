# templates/ci-dotnet.yml — the OPT-IN committed-bundle drift gate.
#
# The hazard, measured on Ninjadog (2026-07-26): `Ninjadog.CLI.csproj` embeds `WebUI/dist/**` as an
# EmbeddedResource, `dist/` is committed, and no MSBuild target calls npm. Bumping the vulnerable
# JS dependency therefore changed the lockfile and NOT ONE BYTE of the shipped binary — while the
# PR closed and the Dependency Dashboard showed the advisory as fixed. That is worse than leaving
# it unfixed: it manufactures a FALSE REMEDIATION.
#
# The steps ship INERT, and that is a measured decision, not timidity (issue #32): across 193 local
# .NET repos, exactly 3 commit build output and exactly 1 has it consumed by the .NET build. A step
# that RAN by default on the other 192 would be deleted or `continue-on-error`'d, which teaches a
# team to ignore a red step — strictly worse than absent.
#
# Inert used to mean "commented out". Since #70 it means an `if:` on live YAML, because a comment
# cost more than it saved: Renovate's github-actions manager cannot see a commented action
# reference. Measured with its own extractor — 5 dependencies from this file with the block as
# text, 7 with it live, the two extra being `actions/setup-node` and `node 26.5.0`. The gate's
# second precondition is a PINNED toolchain (Tailwind v4 and lightningcss ship per-platform native
# binaries), so leaving that pin unmaintainable undercut the very guarantee the step exists to
# provide. Going live also deleted this file's sentinel slicer and un-commenter: the steps are now
# read the way GitHub reads them.
#
# What arms it moved once more, in #96. It was `vars.BUNDLE_DIST != ''` — two repo variables, which
# is *invisible settings state*: a settings tidy-up, a repo transfer (variables do not travel with
# the code), an org policy change or a fork PR makes all three steps evaluate `'' != ''`, they show
# as skipped, and the job is green forever measuring nothing. A repo that never wanted the gate and
# one that LOST it were indistinguishable, and the second is the repo that thinks it is protected.
# So the arming condition is now a COMMITTED file, `.github/bundle-gate.json`, carrying both paths:
# enabling and disabling are diffs again, the config travels with the code, and a fork PR sees it.
#
# What is asserted:
#   1. four live steps — config, setup-node, rebuild, guard — in that order, each gated on the
#      committed config file, with Node pinned to an EXACT version;
#  1c. the config step REFUSES a malformed, untracked, absent or self-inconsistent config rather
#      than exporting nothing and letting the rest of the block run on empty paths;
#  1e. the shipped `templates/bundle-gate.json.example` — the file an adopter copies — is itself a
#      config the gate would accept, not merely valid JSON;
#  1d. a fifth step runs on the ABSENCE of the config and reports a repo that carries a committed
#      bundle consumed by a project — so losing the config stops looking like never wanting it —
#      while staying silent, and green, on the 192 repos that have no such bundle;
#   2. the guard FAILS on a bundle that no longer matches its sources;
#   3. it fails on the content-hash rename (delete + UNTRACKED add), and 3b on the real-world
#      shape where the bundle dir is gitignored and force-added — both invisible to plain
#      `--porcelain`/`git diff`, which is why `--porcelain --ignored` is mandatory;
#   4. the guard PASSES on a bundle that does match — a gate that always fails is not a gate;
#  5b. a misconfigured path is REFUSED rather than passing quietly on nothing, and 5c a directory
#      that exists but holds no tracked file likewise;
#   5. as shipped all four are inert, by a condition that is false when the config file is absent —
#      and nothing outside the gate references the config or the paths it exports;
#  6-9. the coverage artifact step (pre-existing assertions, unrelated to the bundle gate);
#   10. the coverage guard still reports on what it FOUND when the step runs under
#       `set -euo pipefail` — the configuration in which the shipped `find … | grep -q .` idiom
#       inverts and fails the build precisely when coverage WAS produced (#97).
#
# Needs PyYAML, which ci.yml installs before every test step.

# 5. As shipped the four steps are PRESENT but INERT — and inert by the one mechanism GitHub
#    actually evaluates, not by being text.
#
#    The measurement that forces this: of 193 local .NET repos, 3 commit build output and 1 has it
#    consumed by the build. A step that RAN by default on the other 192 would be deleted or
#    `continue-on-error`'d, which teaches a team to ignore a red step — worse than absent.
#
#    So "inert" is checked as: every one of the four carries a condition that is false when the
#    config file is absent, and none of them is `if: always()`-style unconditional. GitHub's
#    expression reference is what makes `hashFiles` usable here — "If the `path` pattern does not
#    match any files, this returns an empty string" — so the 192 get a false condition, never an
#    error. The same page is why the path is written repo-relative: "The `path` is relative to the
#    `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` directory and can only include files inside of the `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`."

# 10. The coverage guard reports on what it FOUND — under `pipefail` too (issue #97).
#
#     The shipped guard is the last `find … | grep -q .` in the kit. It is correct today only by
#     ACCIDENT: GitHub's default step shell is `bash -e {0}`, which has no `pipefail`, so `find`'s
#     status is discarded and the pipeline reports `grep`'s. Two ordinary edits arm it — adding
#     `set -euo pipefail` to this step's body, which the sibling step "Tests + couverture" in the
#     same file ALREADY does, or setting `defaults.run.shell: bash`, which GitHub maps to
#     `bash -eo pipefail`.
#
#     Armed, the guard inverts: `grep -q` exits at the first match, `find` dies on the closed pipe,
#     `pipefail` promotes that to the pipeline's status, and the NEGATED condition takes its
#     then-branch — so the step fails with "Aucun rapport de couverture produit" precisely when
#     coverage WAS produced. In every repo that took the template.
#
#     Three things make this case easy to write wrongly, and all three are why it is shaped as it is:
#
#     * The fixture must OVERRUN the pipe buffer. With less output `find` finishes writing before
#       `grep` closes the pipe, never sees EPIPE, and the bug is simply not reachable — the test
#       would pass against the broken guard and prove nothing. Hence the long path components:
#       they buy the byte volume without tens of thousands of inodes.
#     * A byte threshold alone does NOT establish that. "64 KiB" is Linux's `PIPE_DEF_BUFFERS`
#       (16) x PAGE_SIZE, so on a 64 KiB-page arm64 kernel the capacity is 1 MiB and a 350 KB
#       listing fits entirely — `grep -q` never closes the pipe under a still-writing `find`, the
#       BROKEN guard exits 0, and a test that only checked its own fixture size would go green over
#       a reverted fix. So the naive pipeline is RUN FIRST and required to fail: the reproduction
#       is proven on the host at hand rather than inferred from a constant. Same control as
#       tests/xunit-v3/test.sh section 10, for the same reason.
#     * The fixture's population is proven by COUNTING files, never by reading an exit status.
#       Measured while fixing #48, the status is not even the same on both platforms: BSD find is
#       killed by SIGPIPE (141), GNU find catches EPIPE and returns 1 — and 1 is also what an empty
#       directory yields, so a status-reading test cannot tell "the bug fired" from "I built no
#       fixture". Counting first is what makes the non-zero status unambiguous.
#

#       * `bash -eo pipefail`  — what `defaults.run.shell: bash` maps to;

# SDK, so this is the copy that runs everywhere.
#
# Two shapes, and the difference is not cosmetic. EMPTY is what the step actually meets in CI: the
# sibling step "Tests + couverture" opens with `rm -rf coverage && mkdir -p coverage`, so the
# directory always exists by the time the guard runs. MISSING is the shape that exercises the
# tolerance itself — there `find` exits non-zero and writes to stderr, so a guard without
# `2>/dev/null || true` dies under errexit on find's own message instead of reaching the
# diagnosis. The empty case cannot see that, because there `find` exits 0.

# WHAT QUALIFIES AS ONE MATCH (#126). The two shapes above vary how MANY entries `coverage/` holds;
# these vary what KIND of entry it holds, which the guard used not to ask about at all. `find`
# matches by NAME and has no opinion about type, so ANY entry called `*.cobertura.xml` satisfied a
# bare `-name` test — a directory a collector left behind, or a symlink pointing nowhere on a
# self-hosted runner reusing its workspace (the reason the sibling step opens with
# `rm -rf coverage && mkdir -p coverage`). The step then went green having proved only that a NAME
# exists, and the artifact shipped with nothing parsable in it: the very fail-open this guard was
# written to close, and the same shape as #96 — a green run indistinguishable from a healthy one.
#
# The middle row is why the fix is `find -L … -type f` and NOT the obvious `-type f`. `find` does
# not follow symlinks by default, so `-type f` alone would start refusing a LEGITIMATE report
# reached through a symlink — trading a fail-open for a fail-closed, which is strictly worse
# because the new failure is loud, misleading, and hits working setups. Measured (#126) against
# the shipped expression and both candidates — the three-row table is templates/ci-dotnet.yml's
# own (its "entrée sous coverage/" rationale, read below rather than retyped in English here: #141
# found the two copies asserting against each other, one in French and one in English, with
# nothing to keep them in sync when either changed).
#
# so the symlinked-report row is the one that distinguishes the two candidates, and the regression
# a later "simplification" to a bare `-type f` would introduce. Presence semantics are untouched:
# #31 settled that this guard tests presence and not COUNT, and nothing here compares reports to
# projects.
#
# The symlink's TARGET deliberately lives OUTSIDE `coverage/`. Put it inside and `find` would reach
# the real file directly, the case would pass for a reason that has nothing to do with following
# the link, and a bare `-type f` would survive it — leaving the one row that matters unpinned.
