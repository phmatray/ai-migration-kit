# Golden test for the merge gate's latest-run-per-job reduction (#91).
#
# The gate `merge-pr` applies is a jq program, and until this suite existed nothing ever ran it.
# It was wrong, in both directions, for the same reason: it read the check-runs on a head SHA as a
# FLAT SET, when GitHub gives a HISTORY PER JOB. Several runs of one job coexist on one SHA and
# only the newest is a verdict.
#
#   * Measured on PR #85: head sha 8c58eb2 carried three check-runs all named `kit` — a `cancelled`
#     superseded by the next push, then two `success`. The flat gate classified the PR as failed,
#     entered the corrections loop, found nothing to fix, and refused a PR that was green twice.
#     This repo's own ci.yml sets `cancel-in-progress` (#27/#29), so it produces that shape as a
#     matter of routine.
#   * The symmetric hazard, never yet exercised: a stale `success` from an earlier run sitting
#     beside a newer `failure` for the same job, where "some run succeeded" reads as fine. That is
#     the direction that merges something broken.
#
# One reduction fixes both, so one suite pins both — plus the carve-out that makes the fix safe: a
# job whose LATEST run is `cancelled` still blocks. A superseded cancellation and a real one (a
# human pressing Cancel, a timeout) are different events, and only the second is a verdict.
#
# The program under test is NOT copied here. It is EXTRACTED from the marked block inside
# skills/merge-pr/references/merge-mechanics.md §3 and run verbatim, so the thing this suite proves
# green is the thing an agent pastes. A second copy would drift, and a drifted copy of a gate is
# exactly the failure mode above wearing a passing test.
