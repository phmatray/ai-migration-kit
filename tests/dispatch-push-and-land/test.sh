# Golden test: no dispatch template asks one agent to both push and land (#478).
#
# Two of two CI-restarting dispatches died on one fleet run: each did its work (a conflict
# resolution, a final plan task), pushed — which restarted CI — and then ended its turn to await
# the run its own push had started. The "never dispatch into pending CI" rule as written checks CI
# state at dispatch time, so it answered "not pending" and dispatched. The defect is the
# CONJUNCTION in one prompt: a push verb and a land/merge verb.
#
# Three invariants:
#   1. Every `prompt: "…"` inside an `Agent(` template in skills/auto-dev/SKILL.md is free of the
#      conjunction — checked by a function this suite also drives red over a fixture, so a check
#      that stops matching cannot pass on an empty tree.
#   2. skills/auto-dev/SKILL.md carries the marked push-and-land block: the rule as a property of
#      the dispatch, the split (work → wait-ci → fresh agent), and the #187 cross-reference.
#   3. commands/auto-dev-merge.md tells a phase-2 worker that had to push to stop and report the
#      split by name, never to wait.
#
# Reads only files under skills/auto-dev/ and commands/ — no kit_guard needed.
