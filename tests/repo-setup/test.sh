# Golden test for repo-setup.sh (#192) — the `apply` half of the repo-configuration story.
#
# Why this exists. get-repo-profile's repo-profile.sh ships two verbs and both READ (`show`,
# `detect`). When a probe found no `priority:`/`effort:`/`area:` axis and no
# `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, its only outlet was `TODO: <hint>` — the right answer for a fact it
# cannot read, the wrong one for a configuration the repo does not HAVE. Every repo the lifecycle
# skills are ported into therefore starts degraded: `create-issue` files one label instead of four,
# `auto-dev` sorts a backlog it cannot sort, and nothing anywhere goes red. This suite pins the
# verb that closes that gap.
#
# The properties pinned here are the ones a careless rewrite drops SILENTLY — each is a green-
# looking failure, which is the class this repo keeps rediscovering (#45, #131, #72):
#
#   * idempotence          — a second `apply` issues no writes, and `plan` afterwards exits 0;
#   * additive by default  — a live label absent from the manifest survives unless --prune;
#   * never clobber        — an existing issue form is reported, not overwritten;
#   * degrade per surface  — a refused settings PATCH still leaves the labels applied, exit 3;
#   * `plan` writes nothing, ever — asserted by diffing the target repo around the call.
#
# Every `gh` call goes through a stub on PATH that RECORDS its invocation (the tick-plan pattern),
# so "did not write" is measured rather than assumed.
