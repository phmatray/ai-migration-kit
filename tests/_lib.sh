# tests/_lib.sh — the golden suites' shared preamble. SOURCED, never executed.
#
# Why this file exists (#72). Ten suites each carried their own scratch directory, their own EXIT
# trap and their own copy of the samples/ immutability check — including their own restatement of
# the invariant that `local rc=$?` must be the FIRST statement in the handler. Anything before it
# overwrites the status being reported, which turns a failing suite into a silent green: the one
# outcome worse than a red one.
#
# That is the same hazard tests/xunit-v3/test.sh §8 was written to prevent for the importlib
# loader — an invisible, load-bearing prefix that a copy-paste drops with no symptom — applied to
# the trap handler instead. #42 gave the loader one home; this gives the trap one.
#
# They had already diverged before this landed, which is the usual first sign. The issue counted
# three; a survey found EIGHT; the anti-recurrence check in tests/lib/test.sh then found two more
# that spell the trap as a one-liner. Measured on the four that carried a full `cleanup()`:
#
#     suite              scratch      samples/ check   __pycache__   other
#     audit-inventory    $scratch     yes              no (argued)   —
#     ci-template        $scratch     yes              no            hashes the template
#     renovate-config    $scratch     NO               no            —
#     xunit-v3           ${scratch:-} yes              yes           —
#
# Three spellings of one check, one suite silently missing it, and two spellings of the same
# guard against an unset variable.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- the contract
#
#   kit_source <path>
#       Load another shared helper, or stop the suite NAMING the file it could not load. What it
#       refuses over, and what it cannot, are different lists — and the second one is written down
#       because a docstring promising prevention the code does not perform is worse than no
#       docstring: it is what stops the next reader from adding the check that is missing.
#
#       REFUSES, by name, before the helper can affect the suite:
#         * a path it cannot read;
#         * a path that does not PARSE (`bash -n`), which is what an edit that drops a `fi`, a
#           quote or a brace produces. Bare `. broken.sh` dies inside the source with bash's own
#           `syntax error near unexpected token` and no mention of the helper — measured on bash
#           3.2, exit 2, with the `||` branch never reached — and, because source executes a file
#           as it parses it, only AFTER the helper's earlier top-level commands have run. Both are
#           why the guard has to sit before the source rather than after it.
#
#       DOES NOT prevent, and cannot from here:
#         * a helper whose top level FAILS while executing. Under the caller's `set -e` the shell
#           dies inside the source (measured: exit 1, `||` branch never runs), so the suite stops —
#           loudly, but without kit_source naming the file. Stopping is the safe half; the missing
#           name is the cost.
#         * a helper whose failing command sits in an errexit-exempt context (`if`, `&&`, `||`).
#           The source returns 0, kit_source returns 0, and the suite proceeds with the helper only
#           PARTIALLY loaded — the "runs with half its assertions missing" outcome this helper is
#           otherwise about. Nothing at this level can see it; the failure surfaces later as
#           `<helper-function>: command not found`. §11 pins the paths that ARE guarded so this
#           list cannot quietly grow.
#
#       The FIRST shared file a suite loads is still sourced explicitly — this function lives in
#       one of them, so it cannot load the file that defines it. That bootstrap line is the only
#       one; every source after it is a single call (#128).
#
#   kit_init <kit-root>
#       Arm the EXIT trap. Call once, after the suite's `cd` to the kit root, before any work.
#
#   kit_scratch
#       Print a fresh scratch directory, removed at exit. Call as often as needed, including from
#       a command substitution — see kit_init for why that is not the trap it looks like.
#
#   kit_guard <function-name>
#       Register an extra assertion to run at exit, after the scratch dirs are removed. The
#       function prints its own FAIL message and returns non-zero to fail the run. This is how a
#       suite adds what only it cares about — the template hash, the __pycache__ check — WITHOUT
#       re-implementing the handler around it.
#
#   kit_guard_samples_unchanged
#       The check every suite that builds anything wants: samples/ must come out untouched. Not
#       registered automatically — a suite says so, because "forgot to call it" and "decided it
#       does not apply" must not look the same. That ambiguity is exactly how renovate-config ended
#       up without it.
#
#   first_match <find-args…>
#       Print the FIRST matching path, or nothing — and say why, when there is a reason worth
#       hearing:
#
#           case                     stdout       stderr               exit
#           a match exists           first path   —                    0
#           path exists, no match    (empty)      —                    0
#           starting path absent     (empty)      —                    0
#           any other find failure   (empty)      find's own message   0
#
#       Exit status is ALWAYS 0, on every row. Callers assign in a bare `x=$(first_match …)` under
#       `set -e`, where a non-zero status aborts the caller AT the assignment — before the caller's
#       own "…but it was empty" diagnostic can run (#98). The signal is the stderr, never the
#       status.
#
#       Row 3 is that tolerance, and it stays exactly as quiet as it was: any_match is registered
#       from kit_guard, so a complaint about a legitimately-absent path would print on EVERY exit
#       path, including the successful one. Row 4 is what #124 took back. `2>/dev/null` used to
#       cover it too, so a typo'd predicate or an unreadable directory came back empty and silent,
#       indistinguishable from "no match" — and the caller's diagnostic then sent the reader to
#       investigate the step that was supposed to produce the file. The emptiness test written
#       beneath each call site is only a test if empty means one thing.
#
#       `-quit` stops the walk at the first hit, so what this reports is what the probe SAW before
#       stopping, not a whole-tree verdict: a later unreadable directory may never be visited.
#
#   kit_find_err_is_absent_path_only <stderr-text>
#       True when EVERY line of that text is find's "that starting path is not there" complaint —
#       the one failure first_match suppresses. Split out and named so tests/lib/test.sh can drive
#       it on the wordings a given host cannot produce: BSD, GNU (whose quoting varies with the
#       locale), busybox and bfs each phrase it differently, and a rule verified on one platform's
#       string can lapse silently on another — permissively, re-opening the noise, or strictly,
#       restoring the silence #124 removed.
#
#       What it CANNOT tell apart, and no text rule can: a `-exec`'d command that does not exist.
#       GNU find reports that as `find: 'cmd': No such file or directory` — byte-identical to the
#       complaint about an absent starting path — so it would be suppressed. No call site in this
#       repo passes `-exec` (they are all `-name`/`-type`/`-path` probes), and one that needs to
#       must not read its verdict out of this helper. Written down rather than left to be
#       rediscovered, per the same argument kit_source's contract makes about its own residue.
#
#   any_match <find-args…>
#       The same search read as a yes/no question, without tripping SIGPIPE.
#       `find … | grep -q .` exits 141 under `pipefail` when grep closes the pipe early, and the
#       caller's `if` then reads the failure as "found nothing" — an intermittently disabled
#       guard (#48). Defined in terms of first_match: one home for the tolerance, too.
#
# There is deliberately no `set -euo pipefail` here: the callers set it, and re-setting it in a
# sourced file would mean this file silently decides the shell options of every suite that loads it
# (the reason skills/implement-issue/scripts/_assert-branch.sh gives for the same omission).
