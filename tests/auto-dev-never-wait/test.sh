# Golden test for the auto-dev "never wait" invariant (#187).
#
# Two of three phase-1 workers in a live fleet run were killed after doing essentially all of the
# work: each ended its turn to "wait" for a subagent or background suite it had itself dispatched,
# and a worker that ends its turn has ended its run — its final message IS its report, and nothing
# resumes it (#314: workers are background sub-agents now, and the rule survives the substrate
# change — the deferral just arrives as a report instead of a dead process). `SKILL.md` already
# documented this hazard at length for phase 2 (waiting on CI), but `commands/auto-dev-worker.md` —
# the literal text a phase-1 worker's context is seeded with — said nothing about it at all.
#
# This suite pins two textual invariants so neither regresses silently:
#   1. commands/auto-dev-worker.md carries a hard "never wait" rule, naming the forbidden phrasings
#      a worker actually produced.
#   2. skills/auto-dev/SKILL.md Step 4 recognizes the "died waiting, all boxes ticked" signature and
#      prescribes a tail prompt (not a restart) as its recovery — the worker-side fix does not
#      retroactively rescue a session that already died this way.
#
# Reads only files under commands/ and skills/auto-dev/ — never samples/ — so no kit_guard is needed.
