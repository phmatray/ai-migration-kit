# Golden test for scripts/pinned-literals-check.py — the guard that every spelling of the pinned
# xunit.v3 version is either MARKED as derived from the constant, or RECORDED as historical (#90).
#
# What this suite guards:
#   0. the baseline fixture is genuinely accounted for   -> accept (every mutation below is of it)
#   1. a new copy, neither marked nor recorded           -> REFUSE, naming file:line
#   2. a marked line stating a stale version             -> REFUSE, and never "edit the number"
#   3. a historical line is ignored BECAUSE of its entry -> break the anchor and it refuses
#   4. a HISTORICAL entry that matches nothing           -> REFUSE (a stale allowlist entry lies)
#   5. a HISTORICAL entry covering two lines             -> REFUSE (an over-broad anchor)
#   6. a marker on a line that states no claim           -> REFUSE (it verifies nothing)
#   7. an EXCLUDED path spelling the pin                 -> REFUSE (a copy nothing else looks at)
#   8. no occurrence and no marker anywhere              -> REFUSE rather than pass vacuously
#   9. a directory with no files at all                  -> exit 2, no verdict, never a pass
#  9b. the constant defined more than once               -> exit 2, no verdict, never a guess
#  10. the REAL repository                               -> accept
#  11. a claim wrapped across two physical lines          -> REFUSE, naming the FIRST line, not the 2nd
#  12. a marker on line N does not launder line N+1's own -> both lines refused, independently
#  14. an AGREED pin, two marked occurrences that agree   -> accept
#  15. an AGREED pin, two marked occurrences that disagree -> REFUSE, naming every value seen
#  16. an AGREED pin, exactly one marked occurrence        -> REFUSE (an agreement of one is vacuous)
#  17. the check driven to red — mutations, each of which must silence exactly one case above
#
# The refusal cases are the point. #69's `[7e]` sweep covered two files and said, in the issue it
# spawned, that the rest needed a policy rather than a wider regex — and the hazard in getting that
# policy wrong is not a missed copy but a WRONG EDIT: sweeping the deliberately-historical
# `xunit.v3.mtp-v2` enumerations into agreement destroys the distinction MTP_LINE encodes, and
# deriving the scratch .csproj fixture from the constant makes the transform test assert against
# its own output. So both directions are driven here, over fixtures.
#
# ⚠️ The fixtures pin a FAKE version (see $FAKE below), never the repo's real one. A suite that
# spelled the real pin would itself become an unmarked copy — and the check would be right to
# refuse it. It is also why scripts/pinned-literals-check.py excludes this directory, and why
# section 7 proves that exclusion cannot hide a real copy.
#
# Section lines carry a label, never a fraction: a denominator goes stale the moment a section is
# added, and a stale one reads as a run that stopped early.

# its evidence. Without this the sections above prove the check refuses SOMETHING — not that any
# particular assertion is load-bearing. The mutants are copies; the shipped script is never edited.

# The mutant path comes back in a GLOBAL, never through `m=$(mutate …)`. Command substitution runs
# the function in a SUBSHELL: a `bad` call inside it would increment $fails in a copy that dies
# with the subshell, AND its FAIL line would be captured into $m instead of printed. A mutation
# whose sed stopped matching would then print nothing and exit 0 — a suite reporting green over an
# assertion it never made, which is the one outcome this repo treats as worse than a red run.
