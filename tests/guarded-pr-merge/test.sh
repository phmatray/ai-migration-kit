# Golden test for guarded-pr-merge.sh — the shared decision `merge-pr` Step 5 and the auto-dev
# supervisor's takeover branch both call after a `gh pr merge` (#184).
#
# The bug this closes: `gh pr merge` does two unrelated things — merge on GitHub, then tidy up
# LOCALLY (checkout the base branch, delete the head branch) — under one exit code. On this kit's
# normal layout (every issue in its own worktree) the local half routinely fails even though the
# merge landed, so a caller that trusts the exit code sees a "failed" takeover for a PR GitHub
# already reports MERGED. `merge-pr` Step 5 was fixed for this in #178; the auto-dev supervisor's
# takeover carried its own inline copy and was not, so the same misread survived in the one place
# #178 named as its worst consequence (never freeing a stalled fleet slot). guarded-pr-merge.sh is
# now the one home for the decision, so both callers read it the same way.
#
# A stub `gh` on PATH stands in for both `gh pr merge` and `gh pr view`, modelled on
# tests/tick-plan/test.sh's stub (the kit's existing precedent for testing a script that calls gh
# without touching the network): it never runs on real GitHub, so every fixture below is
# deterministic and offline.
