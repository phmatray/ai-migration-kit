# Golden test for make-worktree.sh — implement-issue's Step 4, driven to red first (#280).
#
# The incident this pins: a phase-1 worker composed its own worktree-ignore check instead of
# calling the kit's, got a false "NOT ignored" verdict (git check-ignore -q without the trailing
# slash, on a directory that does not exist yet), and "fixed" it by committing a .gitignore edit
# into the MAIN checkout — e0ad515, 2026-08-27, docs/desktop-launcher. Every case below drives
# make-worktree.sh over a scratch repository shaped like one side of that incident.

# exactly as this kit's own .gitignore does — but NEITHER directory exists yet, which is the state
# of every fresh checkout and the exact state Step 4 is in before it creates anything. A guard
# spelled `check-ignore -q .worktrees` (no slash) answers "NOT ignored" here; the real
# worktrees-ignored.sh answers "ignored", because it queries with the slash. This case proves that
# false negative cannot come back through this script.

# THIS script, not just a later one. Recreate it instead.
