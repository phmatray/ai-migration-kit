# Golden test for the auto-dev takeover's local cleanup (#227).
#
# `skills/auto-dev/SKILL.md` Step 4's takeover bullet lets the supervisor land a stalled PR itself
# via `guarded-pr-merge.sh` when a worker idles at "ready" twice with CI already final. On a `0`
# (MERGED) verdict, the prose used to stop at "shut the worker down and refill the slot" — the
# script's own header comment is explicit that "local cleanup (branch/worktree teardown) is the
# caller's job", and nothing was ever the caller. Every landed takeover therefore leaked the
# worker's `.claude/worktrees/<branch>/` checkout and local head branch forever, with no follow-up
# triage either — the same guarantee every other merged PR in this kit gets via `merge-pr` Steps
# 6-7, just never invoked here.
#
# The fix reuses the fleet's own phase-2 dispatch contract (a background sub-agent spawned with
# the Agent tool at the cheap tier, invoking `auto-dev-merge <PR>` — the same spawn form Step 3
# already uses, #314) to run a cleanup-only `merge-pr <PR>` after the takeover's MERGED verdict — `merge-pr`'s own Step 1 resume contract
# detects `state == MERGED` and routes straight to Steps 6-7 (follow-up triage, then
# worktree/branch teardown), so the dispatch is pure cleanup with no risk of a second merge
# attempt, and it explicitly does not count against the fleet's N worker slots. This suite pins
# the textual invariants so none regresses silently again; it asserts SKILL.md prose, not runtime
# behavior — this repo has no harness that runs `auto-dev` end-to-end, so its golden suites for
# this skill assert structural properties of the doc itself (see tests/auto-dev-never-wait/test.sh
# for the established pattern).
