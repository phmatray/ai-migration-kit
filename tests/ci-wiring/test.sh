# Golden test for scripts/ci-wiring-check.py — the guard that every tests/<name>/test.sh is run
# by a CI step that can actually fail the build (#45).
#
# What this suite guards:
#   1. the happy path on THIS repo — the real tests/ and the real .github/workflows/
#   2. a suite nothing invokes                        -> REFUSE, naming it
#   3. a step that is commented out                   -> REFUSE (the path survives as comment text)
#   4. a step marked continue-on-error: true          -> REFUSE (runs, fails, build stays green)
#   5. a step marked if: false                        -> REFUSE (never runs)
#   6. `run: ./tests/x/test.sh || true`               -> REFUSE (exit status discarded)
#   7. a workflow with no automatic trigger           -> REFUSE (workflow_dispatch is not CI)
#   8. a pull_request-only workflow                   -> REFUSE (#133: never runs on a push to main)
#   9. push-to-main AND pull_request                  -> accept (the fix must not refuse ci.yml)
#  10. every other `push:` filter shape               -> the branch filter is actually read
#  11. an empty tests/ directory                      -> REFUSE, never a vacuous "all wired"
#  12. every tests/<name>/ named in README.md exists  -> the prose cannot outlive the directory
#  13. wired, but committed 100644 (Windows core.filemode=false) -> REFUSE, naming the mode + fix
#  14. the happy path stays a pass with a real, staged 100755 fixture
#  15. not a git repository at all                    -> REFUSE, mode is unknowable, not a pass
#  16. a suite committed as a symlink (120000)         -> REFUSE, without the fatal --chmod=+x fix
#  17. a suite name git quotes (non-ASCII)             -> still caught at the wrong mode
#  18. both defects at once (unreadable index AND a genuinely unwired suite) -> both are named
#  19. a suite that is wired but never `git add`ed        -> REFUSE, naming it and the `git add` fix
#  20. a suite that is BOTH untracked AND unwired          -> both reasons named, neither contradicts
#      the other (the "not executable" reason must not claim CI invokes a suite the "not enforced"
#      reason just said nothing invokes)
#  21. untracked AND wired-but-continue-on-error          -> REFUSE, but never claims "no step
#      invokes it" — a step does, it just can't fail the build (#238)
#  22. untracked AND wired-but-pull_request-only          -> same contradiction, reached via the
#      workflow-level reason instead of the step-level one (#238)
#  23. wrong index mode AND genuinely uninvoked            -> the sibling contradiction on the
#      wrong-mode print branch, mirroring 21/22 on the mode-is-None branch (#238)
#
# The refusal cases are the point. A gate is worth exactly what its refusal path is worth, and an
# inline `run:` block cannot have one — which is why scripts/release-title-gate.sh was extracted
# from yaml after its inline version failed open, and why this one starts out extracted.
#
# Section lines carry a label, never a fraction: a denominator goes stale the moment a section is
# added, and a stale one reads as a run that stopped early.

# "Runs on a push to main" is not "has a push: key": the branch filter decides it, and most of the

# because the interesting part is the filter rather than the fixture — one section apiece would be a
# dozen near-identical copies of the block above.
#
# The `!` rows are the subtle ones. `!` is filter syntax, not part of a branch name, and GitHub lets
# the LAST matching pattern in the list decide — so `["**", "!main"]` does NOT run on main and
# `["!main", "**"]` does. Read as an unordered "does any pattern match", the first of those two
# reads as enforced: the same fail-open this whole issue is about, one level down inside the fix.
#
# Each case is asserted parsed before its verdict is read, for the reason at the top of this file:
# a mangled `on:` block would be refused too, by accident, and every want=1 row would then pass
# without exercising anything. The reason substring is the second half of that guard — it is what
# separates "refused because the branch filter misses main" from "refused for some other reason".

# AND an unreadable index only ever reported the index problem: fixing the index and re-running was
# the only way to learn about the unwired suite, one problem per run instead of both at once.
