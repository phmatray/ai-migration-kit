# Golden test for the repo-root .gitattributes — the `eol=lf` rule the raw-line gates depend on
# (#174).
#
# Why this suite exists. Three of the kit's gates read their own repository line by line, and each
# one compares a raw line against a literal: parse-sweep.sh matches a heredoc terminator against the
# delimiter it captured, ci-wiring-check.py matches a suite path against the string a workflow
# spells. On a checkout whose working copy is CRLF — the default on Windows with `core.autocrlf=true`
# and no attribute to say otherwise — every one of those comparisons is against a line carrying a
# trailing CR, and the gates refuse a tree that is perfectly fine. Measured at ce23b73: 11 suites
# REFUSED by the sweep, 19 by the wiring check, on a tree CI was green on.
#
# The fix is not per-script CR tolerance — teaching parse-sweep to accept `PY\r` would make it AGREE
# with a file the bash 3.2 it emulates still chokes on. The fix is to remove the premise: pin the
# working copy to LF, for every checkout, in a committed file.
#
# What each section can go RED on, here on Linux, without a Windows host:
#   1. a blob committed with CRLF                    — the content half, which no checkout rule fixes
#   2. the eol attribute unset for a gate-read file  — RED today: there is no .gitattributes
#   3. .gitattributes untracked                      — a rule nobody inherits is not a rule
#   4. the rule failing to govern a real CHECKOUT    — a `core.autocrlf=true` fixture, which is
#                                                      reproducible on Linux and is exactly the
#                                                      Windows condition
#   5. the consequence, demonstrated                 — parse-sweep REFUSES a CRLF copy of a file it
#                                                      passes as LF, so the premise cannot rot into
#                                                      folklore
#
# Sections 1-3 assert the rule; 4 proves it does what it claims; 5 proves it is worth claiming.
# Section lines carry a label, never a fraction: a denominator goes stale the moment a section is
# added, and a stale one reads as a run that stopped early.

# this suite was written red against. An answer of `lf` that came from a machine's `core.autocrlf`
# is not possible here: core.autocrlf is a config setting, not an attribute, so a passing verdict
# means a committed rule is doing the work.
#
# The list is the files the raw-line gates READ, plus this suite: it is the reason each one is
# named, and a reader adding a fourth raw-line gate should add it here.

# working copy on checkout while storing LF in the index — `i/lf w/crlf`, exactly what
# `git ls-files --eol` reported on the host in #174.
#
# Asserted as a PAIR, and the pair is the point. "the working copy came out LF" proves nothing on
# its own — it is also what a repo with autocrlf off would show — so the control comes first: the
# same repo, same setting, no .gitattributes, must come back CRLF. Only then does the second half
# mean the rule did the work.

# --------------------------------------------------- 5. the consequence the rule exists to prevent
# Mechanism 1 of #174, reproduced here rather than described. The fixture is the shape the kit's
# suites are full of — a heredoc with a QUOTED delimiter opened inside a `$( … )`:
#
#     x=$(python3 - <<'PY'
#     print("ok")
#     PY
#     )
#
# The quoting matters. parse-sweep captures the delimiter by stripping to the closing quote, so it
# gets `PY`, while the terminator line on a CRLF copy is `PY` + CR. They never compare equal, the
# scan runs off the end of the file, and the sweep does what it is designed to do when a scan cannot
# complete: refuse, loudly. The refusal is correct behaviour on a false premise — which is why the
# fix is the premise, and why parse-sweep itself is deliberately NOT changed by #174.
