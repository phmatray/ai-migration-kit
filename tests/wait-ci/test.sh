# Golden test for skills/auto-dev/scripts/wait-ci.sh (#188).
#
# The script used to model a repo as having exactly ONE gating check, picked by a hardcoded
# default name (`CHECK="Build & Test"`) and matched against `gh pr checks`'s plain-text table.
# On a repo with two independently-gating checks (this kit's own `kit` + `title-gate`) no single
# name is correct: the default matches nothing and hangs to MAX_POLLS/exit 1, and setting CHECK to
# either name false-greens past the other.
#
# Field/vocabulary pin (Task 1 Step 1, gh 2.97.0, measured 2026-08-30):
#   $ gh pr checks --help
#     JSON FIELDS: bucket, completedAt, description, event, link, name, startedAt, state, workflow
#     "the --json flag ... includes a `bucket` field, which categorizes the `state` field into
#      `pass`, `fail`, `pending`, `skipping`, or `cancel`"
#   $ gh pr checks <a real PR> --json name,state,bucket
#     [{"bucket":"pass","name":"kit","state":"SUCCESS"}, {"bucket":"pass","name":"title-gate","state":"SUCCESS"}]
# `bucket` is gh's OWN classification (cli/cli pkg/cmd/pr/checks/aggregate.go: a switch on the raw
# check-run/status state that maps SUCCESS->pass, SKIPPED/NEUTRAL->skipping, the failure states->
# fail, CANCELLED->cancel, and everything else — QUEUED, IN_PROGRESS, PENDING, STALE, WAITING,
# ACTION_REQUIRED's absence, any future state gh adds — to the `pending` default case). So
# "final" = "bucket != pending" tracks exactly what the old script's `all_final` meant, without
# this script having to maintain its own copy of gh's raw-state vocabulary.
#
# Second pin, found by code review: gh does not print `[]` for a PR with zero checks — it FAILS
# the whole call, even with --json (cli/cli's `populateStatusChecks` errors before the exporter
# ever runs). Measured on PR #291 of this repo (a release-please branch with no CI wired):
#   $ gh pr checks 291 --json name,state,bucket ; echo $?
#     (stdout empty) / stderr: no checks reported on the 'release-please--...' branch / exit 1
# That is indistinguishable on stdout alone from a TRANSIENT gh failure (rate limit, network
# blip), so cases 6-7 below pin that the script tells them apart by stderr text rather than
# folding every non-zero exit into "zero checks".
