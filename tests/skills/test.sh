# Golden test for check-frontmatter.py.
#
# That checker is an ABSENCE rule: it asserts skill frontmatter carries no `version`
# key (#16). An absence rule has no positive witness in the repo — the six real skills
# already satisfy it — so a pattern that quietly stops matching keeps printing
# "frontmatter OK" and CI cannot tell. Typo the key to `versionn`, drop a spelling,
# narrow the check out of existence: all stay green. This file is that missing witness.
#
# It also pins the two bugs the #16 review found in the first, regex-based attempt:
#   - `^[ \t]*version:` also matched indented continuation lines of a `>-` block
#     scalar, so PROSE tripped the guard (false positive, cases N2/N3 below);
#   - it missed `"version":`, `'version':`, `version :` and the flow form
#     `metadata: {version: 1}`, all the same key to YAML (false negatives, P2–P5).
# Both are why the checker parses YAML instead of pattern-matching.

# spellings kept getting re-introduced before that — a caller resolving `-C` from
# `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` right next to a worktrees-ignored.sh call (fails OPEN from a
# linked worktree, tests/worktrees-ignored/test.sh case 22) and an `awk '{p=$2}'` listing that
# truncates a checkout under a path containing a space. This is the anti-recurrence guard: it
# scans the real skills/ tree, not a scratch copy, because the defect IS the committed prose and
# scripts, not something a fixture could stand in for.
#
# Proximity, not "the file mentions both": skills/get-repo-profile/scripts/repo-profile.sh
# legitimately carries an UNRELATED `rev-parse --show-toplevel` (line ~30, resolving the profile
# PATH argument — out of scope for #125, see the issue's own Assumptions) alongside four
# worktrees-ignored.sh mentions dozens of lines away. A whole-file substring check would flag that
# file forever; only a call sitting near a guard invocation is the actual bug.
