## Step 5 — Merge (squash)

Only once CI is green **and** `mergeStateStatus == CLEAN`. The profile's *Integration style* sets how to
land; for squash-merge (the `(#NNN)` commits on `main`):

```bash
<kit>/skills/merge-pr/scripts/guarded-pr-merge.sh "$PR" \
  -- --squash --delete-branch --subject "<PR title — already ends in (#issue)> (#$PR)"
  # --subject is optional; omit it (drop the whole -- line down to --delete-branch) to accept gh's default
```

`<kit>` is the kit root (the placeholder `references/merge-mechanics.md` defines), printed at session
start as `Kit root:` and named in every write-gate denial; a guard you cannot find is a reason to
resolve `<kit>`, never to run `gh pr merge` yourself.

**Prefer omitting `--subject`.** `implement-issue` titled the PR `… (#issue)`, and gh's default squash
subject is that title with `(#PR)` appended — giving the canonical `… (#issue) (#PR)` shape
automatically. If you override it, keep the `(#issue)` or you drop the link to the originating issue.

### The exit code doesn't decide — GitHub's state does

`gh pr merge` does **two unrelated things**: it merges the PR **on GitHub**, then tidies up **locally**
(check the base branch out, delete the merged branch). One exit code covers both, so it can never say
which half failed — and the local half fails on this kit's *normal* layout, not an exotic one.
`implement-issue` gives every issue its own worktree, so `/merge-pr` is usually run from one; gh then
switches to the base branch, the primary checkout already holds it, and git refuses:

```
$ gh pr merge 176 --squash --delete-branch
failed to run git: fatal: 'main' is already used by worktree at '<path>/ai-migration-kit'
```

That merge **landed** — only gh's post-merge `git checkout` failed. Run from the primary checkout
instead and you get the *other* message, `failed to delete local branch … used by worktree` (§9's
long-standing row), because gh only needs to switch branches when you are sitting on the head branch.
Two messages, one rule: **the merge call's exit status is advisory.** Its stderr is worth reporting;
it concludes nothing. `guarded-pr-merge.sh` is the one home for that decision (#184) — it runs the
merge, reads the PR's `state` back itself, and exits distinctly per outcome instead of handing you the
raw exit code:

| `guarded-pr-merge.sh` exit | what it means | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| `0` MERGED | the merge landed, whatever `gh pr merge`'s own exit code said | continue to **Step 6**. If that exit code was non-zero, that was local cleanup gh couldn't finish — Step 7 does it, so report it there, not as a failed merge |
| `1` QUEUED | still `OPEN`, but the merge call itself exited 0 — a successful merge-queue enqueue, not a rejection | let it land and re-read later; do not retry the merge |
| `2` REJECTED | still `OPEN` and the merge call exited non-zero — a real rejection | do **not** reach for `--admin`; surface it (the script prints the merge call's stderr) and stop |
| `3` CLOSED | the PR was closed without merging while this ran | Step 1's rule applies — stop and ask. Merging a deliberately closed PR is not a safe default |
| `4` UNCONFIRMED | the state readback itself did not answer after a few attempts | inconclusive — it says neither merged nor rejected. **Stop and report the merge as unconfirmed.** Do *not* fall through into Step 7 — its teardown is destructive and assumes the merge landed. Re-running the skill later is safe: Step 1 routes an already-`MERGED` PR straight on to Steps 6-7 |

Full exit-code contract and the merge-queue disambiguation are in the script's own header comment —
read it there, don't mirror it here; a second copy is exactly what #184 removed.

**Don't corroborate with the remote branch.** Whether `--delete-branch` reached the remote side before
the local step failed is exactly what the exit code won't tell you — and on a repo with GitHub's own
`delete_branch_on_merge` enabled (this one has it), the branch disappears either way. A missing remote
branch proves nothing about the merge, and a surviving one disproves nothing. `state` — read by the
script — is the only signal that answers the question.

Local cleanup is Step 7's either way (gh can't delete a branch checked out in a worktree; its **Case
B** is this same collision one step later). Take the `|| git switch --detach` fallback from
`references/merge-mechanics.md` §8 when you get there — the obvious "switch back to `main`" walks
straight into the collision that got you here. §9 of that reference carries the row keyed on the
literal message.

### Multi-issue PRs: keep the changelog honest

On a repo with release automation (e.g. `release-please`), the version bump and CHANGELOG entries
derive from **Conventional Commits on `main`**. A squash-merge collapses the whole PR into a single
commit, so a PR that closes several issues yields exactly one release-notes line and one bump —
under-reporting the work.

When squash-merging a PR that closes **more than one issue**, write the squash-commit **body** with
one Conventional Commit line per distinct change, e.g.:

    fix(export): use invariant culture in CSV number formatting (#91)

    feat(export): stream large report downloads (#58, #77)
    feat(export): add XLSX export alongside CSV (#90)

Verify the resulting release PR lists an entry per line. If the release tooling does not split the
body, prefer not bundling unrelated issues into one squash in the first place.
