# base-run-followup.sh — one bounded, non-polling follow-up lookup for a timeout-reasoned
# unverified base verdict (#561).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `base-run-verdict.sh`'s poll loop treats two different situations as
# `timeout`: CI genuinely still pending, and CI clear but the reduced job-name signature hasn't
# repeated across two consecutive polls (the partially-posted-job-graph guard #355 already
# argues for). Under a single worker that converges inside the default 600s budget; under several
# `auto-dev` workers all pushing to the same base and sharing the same CI runners, the job graph
# for one sha can keep shifting long enough that two identical readings never happen inside the
# budget, even though the run is genuinely converging toward green. Measured on this repo,
# 2026-09-12: a 5-worker fleet run answered `unverified (timeout)` for two merges (PR #543/#521,
# PR #549/#520) whose base run had in fact already finished cleanly by the time a human
# re-checked by hand, minutes later, with exactly the lookup this script now makes.
#
# WHAT IT DOES. Exactly ONE `gh run list` lookup for the base branch, resolved BY THE EXACT SHA
# (never by recency — multiple matches resolve to the newest `createdAt`, mirroring
# `base-run-verdict.sh`'s own "reduced, newest wins" rule) — never a second poll loop, never a
# sleep. Maps the result into the SAME report-line grammar (`^(green|RED|unverified) \([a-z-]+\)$`,
# #455) `base-run-verdict.sh` already emits for its own workflow-runs fallback:
#
#   a completed, successful run for the sha           -> green (base-run)
#   a completed, failed run for the sha                -> RED (base-run)
#   no match, or the matched run has no conclusion yet
#     (still queued/in_progress), or the lookup itself
#     fails                                             -> unverified (timeout)
#
# Any other completed conclusion (`cancelled`, `skipped`, `neutral`, `timed_out`,
# `action_required`, `stale`) falls into the last bucket too — this script's whole point is one
# extra free look at a run that was still converging, not a second CI-rule engine; a cancelled or
# otherwise inconclusive run is not evidence the base broke, so it stays a non-verdict rather than
# a fabricated red (the same doctrine `base-run-verdict.sh`'s own cancelled-run handling states).
#
# ACROSS EVERY WORKFLOW ON THE SHA, NEVER JUST THE NEWEST OVERALL. `gh run list --branch` lists
# every workflow that ran on that branch, and a push to it commonly triggers more than one
# (this repo's own `ci` and `release-please` both fire on a push to `main`, at the same sha).
# Taking the single newest entry regardless of which workflow it belongs to would let a fast,
# unrelated workflow's `success` (release-please, GitHub Pages) stand in for the actual CI run —
# exactly the `pages-build-deployment`/`release-please` trap `05b-base-run.md` already forbids one
# paragraph above this script's own call site. So matches are grouped BY WORKFLOW NAME first (the
# newest per group, mirroring `base-run-verdict.sh`'s own per-job `.latest` reduction, extended to
# workflow granularity since `gh run list` cannot see individual jobs); the verdict is `green` only
# when EVERY workflow's latest run for the sha succeeded, `RED` the instant any one of them failed,
# and `unverified (timeout)` when any is inconclusive (still running, or no run at all) — so a
# quick, unrelated workflow's `success` never launders a genuinely slow or broken one.
#
# `merge-pr` Step 5b calls this ONLY when `base-run-verdict.sh --report-line`'s own reason was
# exactly `timeout`; every other verdict/reason is unaffected and this script is never invoked for
# them. It invents no CI rule of its own — decisions/registry.json's `not_decisions` records why,
# the same reasoning as `base-run-verdict.sh`'s own entry.
#
# Usage:
#   base-run-followup.sh [-R <owner/repo>] <base-branch> <sha>
#
# ALWAYS prints exactly one report-line and exits 0 — a non-verdict is a valid answer, not a
# failure, for the same reason `base-run-verdict.sh` documents: a post-merge read must never give
# an autonomous fleet a new way to get stuck on a merge that already landed. The one refusal,
# exit 64, is a usage error before any `gh` call: no base branch, no sha, an unparseable option, or
# (mirroring `base-run-verdict.sh`) a kit whose host helper will not load (#514).
