# finish-task.sh — close one plan task in ONE call: commit through the guard, tick the task's
# checkboxes on the issue plan (and its `- [ ] Task <k>` line in the PR's `### Plan` mirror), push
# through the guard.
#
# Why (#499): implement-issue Step 6 closed a task in four to six tool turns — edit the plan file
# per line, edit the PR mirror, tick-plan.sh, gh pr edit, guarded-commit.sh, guarded-push.sh — and
# every turn re-reads the whole context. Measured average: 127 turns per run. This is the same
# sequence, in the same order Step 6 prescribes (commit → tick → mirror → push), in one turn.
#
# It composes the existing guards and never bypasses one: the commit goes through
# guarded-commit.sh, the issue write through tick-plan.sh (fail-closed, read-back verified), the
# push through guarded-push.sh. Each stage's exit code is this script's exit code, prefixed with
# the stage name, so a resume knows where to pick up; a stage already done is skipped, not redone
# (nothing to commit → "already committed"; no unticked box in the task → "already ticked").
#
# Usage:
#   finish-task.sh --repo <[host/]owner/repo> --issue <n> --task <k> --worktree <dir> --branch <name>
#                  [--pr <n>] [--comment-id <id>] [-c key=value]… [-m <message>] [--dry-run]
#
#   --repo        OWNER/REPO, or HOST/OWNER/REPO for a GitHub Enterprise host. The host is resolved
#                 once, by skills/_shared/scripts/_gh-host.sh (#514), and tick-plan.sh inherits it
#   --task        the `### Task <k>` block whose `- [ ]` lines are flipped — only that block
#   --pr          the PR whose body carries the `### Plan` mirror; omitted → the mirror is skipped
#   --comment-id  the plan lives in that comment, not the issue body (older issues)
#   -c            forwarded to guarded-commit.sh (commit identity), repeatable
#   -m            the commit message; default: the task's last step, `Commit: \`…\``
#   --dry-run     print what each stage would do; write nothing anywhere
#
# Exit: 0 all stages done or already done · 64 usage · 65 task not found / no message ·
#       otherwise the failing stage's own exit code, named on stderr.
